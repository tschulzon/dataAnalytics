# dataAnalytics
A project in my fourth semester with a teammember.

We got many different tasks to solve relating to wind turbines in bavaria. We had to work with python in the jupyter notebook.

We had to extract the data from websites from the wind turbines and should choose the most important data for us and then work with this data
in the following tasks. There were also many tasks where we had to create graphs, normal and interactive ones.

More you can see in the code but it is everything in german, sorry :)
